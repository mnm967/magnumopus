  - [ ] Implement basic moderation features (e.g., admin delete message)
- [ ] **User Profile & Subscription**
  - [ ] Implement actual subscription tier checking from Firestore/Auth custom claims
  - [ ] Persist watched lessons to Firestore
- [ ] **Course Content**
    - [ ] Integrate actual video URLs from Firebase Storage for lessons
    - [ ] Replace mock CourseRepository with Firestore-backed implementation

### 2. AI Integration (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Cloud Functions Setup**
  - [ ] Configure Firebase Cloud Functions
  - [ ] Create OpenAI proxy function for secure API calls

- [ ] **AI Assistant Implementation**
  - [ ] Create AI chat interface (similar to community chat but 1-on-1 with AI)
  - [ ] Implement text-based AI conversations via Cloud Functions
  - [ ] Add image upload and analysis feature for AI chat
  - [ ] Implement AI response caching (if applicable)

- [ ] **Content Summarization**

- [ ] Add unit and widget tests for key features and providers
- [ ] Review and improve Firebase security rules for production readiness
- [ ] Optimize image loading, caching, and video streaming performance

## Current Roadmap Timeline
1. **Phase 1 (Complete)**: Core UI with animations, authentication, basic course browsing, initial community chat, profile and subscription screens.
2. **Phase 2 (Next 2 weeks)**: Connect to live Firestore data (courses, channels), complete video playback with actual URLs, refine chat moderation, implement subscription tier logic.
3. **Phase 3 (Following 2 weeks)**: AI integration (Cloud Functions, AI chat, summaries), advanced community features.
4. **Phase 4 (Final 2 weeks)**: Polish, testing, analytics, performance optimization, and admin functionality (if prioritized).

## Notes
